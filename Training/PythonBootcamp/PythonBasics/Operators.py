# Operators exercise
a = 9
b = 2

# CODE STARTS HERE:

# c equals a divided by b
c = a / b

# d equals a raised to the power of b
d = a ** b

# e equals the remainder of a divided by b
e = a % b

# conventions
# distance from LA to NYC in miles
distance_miles = 2806

# distance in Km
distance_km = distance_miles * 1.609

# temperature in degrees Celsius
temperature_c = 25

# the temperature T in degrees Fahrenheit (°F) is equal to the temperature T in degrees Celsius (°C) times 9/5 plus 32
# temperature in degrees Fahrenheit
temperature_f = 25 * 9 / 5 + 32

# size in inches
inch = 17

# 1 inch is equal to 2.54 centimeters
# size in cm
cm = inch * 2.54
